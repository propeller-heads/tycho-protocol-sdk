# Accounts that will be automatically initialized at test start
# IMPORTANT: These are TEST FIXTURES ONLY. Your actual code must still properly
# initialize these accounts. This configuration only eliminates the need to include
# historical blocks containing the initialization events in your test data.
#
# Example use case:
# - Your substream would normally initialize account XYZ at block 10000
# - Your test only includes blocks 20000-21000 for efficiency
# - You list XYZ here so the test environment will automatically initialize the account XYZ with the state it had at block 20000
# - Your actual substream code MUST STILL contain the initialization and state tracking logic for this contract
#
# Without this, you would need to include block 10000 in your test data or your
# test would fail because the account appears uninitialized to your code.
