# 1. Setup

### Install Rust

*   Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), you can do so with the following command:

    ```bash
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

### Install Substreams

*   Install [Substreams CLI](https://substreams.streamingfast.io/getting-started/installing-the-cli), you can either use brew:

    ```bash
    brew install streamingfast/tap/substreams
    ```

    use precompiled binaries

    ```bash
    # Use correct binary for your platform
    LINK=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/streamingfast/substreams/releases/latest | awk '/download.url.*linux/ {print $2}' | sed 's/"//g')
    curl -L  $LINK  | tar zxf -
    ```

    or compile from source:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/streamingfast/substreams
    cd substreams
    go install -v ./cmd/substreams
    ```

### Create a new package

1.  Start by making a local copy of the Propeller Protocol Lib repository:\


    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/propeller-heads/propeller-protocol-lib
    ```
2.  Create a new directory for your integration by copying the template, rename all the references to `ethereum-template` to `[CHAIN]-[PROTOCOL_SYSTEM]`:

    ```bash
    cp -r ./substreams/ethereum-template ./substreams/[CHAIN]-[PROTOCOL_SYSTEM]
    ```
3.  Now, generate the required protobuf code by running:

    ```bash
    substreams protogen substreams.yaml --exclude-paths="sf/substreams,google"
    ```
4. Next, register the new package within the workspace by adding it to the members list in `substreams/Cargo.toml`.
